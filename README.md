## Droneshield Tech Test

To frontend and backend navigate to root of project.

Change permissions of bash script file;
```chmod +x start-app.sh```

Then run the start script;
```./start-app.sh```

This will run backend in docker containers for node.js and postgres, and run frontend in dev mode.


## Possibly use TimescaleDB in future? 

Fireship released video on TimescaleDB on weekend, might be useful for sensor data; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Tzh_0lHJ8
